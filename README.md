# MyBeezBox technical test for apprenticeship candidates

First off, thank you for your interest in MyBeezBox. We appreciate your application, and the time you will dedicate during this process.
The goal of this test is for us to understand if we'd be happy working together. It's an opportunity for you to showcase your skills and your ability to grow.

## The actual test

Please implement a [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), where two players can take turns playing.
We expect that the two players are seating in front of the same machine, taking turns playing. In particular we do **not** expect the code to run on two different machines talking to one another. One machine, two players.
The application should either run in a web page (using Javascript for example), or within a shell (using Python for example).

### Technical details

Please do not spend more than two hours of your time working on this test. We value your time, and we also want to see what you are able to do in a timely manner.

We should have sent you an email address to send your work to. The format of the result is up to you: a fork of this repo, a zipped git repository, only files, etc.
Please make it clear how we should install your code if needed, and how we should **run** it.

If you have questions about the test, don't hesitate to reach out to us ðŸ“§

## What you can expect after your submission

We will take a look at your submission as soon as we're able. Again, we value your time.
If we decide not to move forward, we will let you know via email. We will try and include feedback regarding the code you sent.
If we decide to move forward, you will be invited to a ~1h interview. We will go over your submission, ask questions, talk about your choices, etc.

Looking forward to hearing from you :v:

## Second test

I'd like players to now play on a 5x5 grid, not 3x3. Players still win with three symbols in a row, column or diagonal.
